Breakdance Music Recognition 

A front-end web application for music recognition with a back-end modified based on the <a href="https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu">dejavu</a> project.

The application supports both audio recording and audio file recognition. Recognition results are stored in a MariaDB (MySQL) database, and a unique, shareable URL is generated for each query.

This repository contains the project source code, with graphic designs and database passwords removed.
